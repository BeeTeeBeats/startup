# CS 260 Notes

## Intro to GitHub
I learned a bit more about what all of the individual steps of Git do. Git just tracks the versions in a folder.
* "Adding" a file just means that the folder will track the changes.
* "Committing" means that the folder takes a snapshot of how it currently looks.
* "Pushing" means that anyone else who is linked to that repository will be able to see your changes.
* "Pulling" means accepting the changes that someone else made.
